    //Java uses OOP: Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

//class is a model for an object, it is the blueprint of the state and behavior(methods) We have states(attributes) with values. We also have methods. Objects act upon objects invoking different behaviors or methods.

//Instance of a class has its own variables(attributes) and methods(behavior)
//Since classes communicate with other classes through relationships, in order to create real life relationships, we must define a classes with states and behaviors before actually coding anything out.
