//declaring variables, we first need to declare the datatype, then the name and set it equal to something;
    //Basic data types:
        //byte, short, int, long all store numbers, byte stores 1,2,4,and 8 bytes respectively.
        //float, double are numbers with decimals that can hold 4 and 8 bytes respectively. Doubles can store more decimal values and therefore more specific.
        //char stores a character 
        //boolean stores 1 byte T/F
