public double getBalance(int accountId){
    //logic
    return balance
}

//Lets x-ray through this

//public is an access modifier; which basically tells us that anyone can access this method if calling the class?

//double is just the return type. Like int or float. Doble means we will have lots of characters, and does not lose any char characteristic if used instead.

//getBalance is just the method name.

//accountId is the parameter

//Between the brackets is our method body where we have our logic and the return statment
