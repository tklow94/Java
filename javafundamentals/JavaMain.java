//Try declaring a class with no methods or variables

//We also need a main Method for the class. The main method is needed for the program to execute.
    //It is always called main, and starts with public static void main()

//a main method must always take an array of String objects. Where String[] is telling us the parameter args (which can be called anything is an array of string objects).
