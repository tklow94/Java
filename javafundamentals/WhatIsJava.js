//Java is more than just a high-order OOP language.
    //It is a full platform with API, tools, and a developer community.
    //.java files are compiled into byte code using the JAVA compiler and the byte code is then executed using the JVM (JAVA virtual machine)
        //Bytecode is stored in binary .class files
        //Virtual Machine: Means it is easy to use on different OS, and that Java is an interpreted language.

//Check out HellWorld.java


//How are Java projects structures?
    //All the Java files are in a single directory, in which there are more folders which contain files associated with a specific package.
    //The main is typically called src
    //Classes are separated into a separate folder called classes.


//Java core Concepts (high overview)
    //Variables: How data is stored. Different variable types tell us what data can be contained in it and what operations can be executed. 
        //We have integers, strings, etc.
        //Variables must be declared, assigned a value, execute operations on the variables, and then record the outcome of the operation.
        //int myNumber;
        //myNumber = 0;
        //myNumber = myNumber + 5;
