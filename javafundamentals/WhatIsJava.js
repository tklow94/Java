//Java is more than just a high-order OOP language.
    //It is a full platform with API, tools, and a developer community.
    //.java files are compiled into byte code using the JAVA compiler and the byte code is then executed using the JVM (JAVA virtual machine)
        //Bytecode is stored in binary .class files
        //Virtual Machine: Means it is easy to use on different OS, and that Java is an interpreted language.

//How are Java projects structures?
    //All the Java files are in a single directory, in which there are more folders which contain files associated with a specific package.
    //The main is typically called src
    //Classes are separated into a separate folder called classes.


//Java core Concepts (high overview)
    //Variables: How data is stored. Different variable types tell us what data can be contained in it and what operations can be executed. 
        //We have integers, strings, etc.
        //Variables must be declared, assigned a value, execute operations on the variables, and then record the outcome of the operation.
        //int myNumber;
        //myNumber = 0;
        //myNumber = myNumber + 5;
    //Classes and Objects: Classes group variables and operations together. They are not objects but can instantiate them in instances of that class. Class is the blueprint to create the object. Classes can have fields, constructors, and methods.
        //Fields: Variable that belongs to a class or object, like the word brand is a variable of a car. 
        //Constructors: Type of method that are executed when an object is created. They typically initialize the variables that belong to a class.
        //Methods: Groups of operations that carry out a function.
